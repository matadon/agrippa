# Agrippa

Agrippa embodies a set of programming practices taken from several years
of production Ruby development at scale. It provides a set of shortcuts for
handling state manipulation, delegation, proxy objects, and the like.

This gem is currently pending release.

## Installation

Run `gem install agrippa`, or add `gem "agrippa"` to your `Gemfile`.

Agrippa has currently only been tested against MRI, but should work fine
on JRuby as well, with the possible exception of `Agrippa::Immutable`

## Examples

```ruby

```

## TODO

Actually write some documentation.

Test against JRuby, possibly with a better set of immutable data structures.
